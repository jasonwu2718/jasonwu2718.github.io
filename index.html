        Hi! I'm Jason Wu, a senior at HHH High School East. 
        Currently, I am conducting research under the direction of Dr. Eric Rowland of Hostra University.
        I'm also member of my high school's Varsity Cross Country, Winter Track, and Spring Track teams, as well as it's Varsity Chess and Mathletes teams. 
        In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing the piano, and hooping with friends.
        Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
